# freebsd-git-weekly

This repository is currently (2025-09-09) undergoing massive refactoring; it
should much cleaner in a few days (say, 2025-9-12).

Anybody looking at this is probably interested in:
- [projects/freebsd/classify.toml](projects/freebsd/classify.toml)
- [src/commits_periodical/classify.py](src/commits_periodical/classify.py)
